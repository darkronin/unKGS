# unKGS
The un-conventional KGS app.

Look up any active KGS player for receiving some aggregated information at your fingertips!

A no-frills test web app, written leveraging OpenUI5 and metaKGS.


## How it works

After loading up the OpenUI5 framework (about 500 KB), it presents a clean screen with an input field to specify the username you wish to query.
The query submits a request to the archives page via metaKGS, and drills down, parsing up to two games in order to extract some more information.

## Features
 - *player's strength* vs *_average_ opponents' strength*
 - _friendly_ indicator (greets/thanks after game) â˜º
 - Rengo indicator ðŸ‘¥
 - _opening style_ indicators: what player usually plays in the first 4 moves. The most standard moves are recognized: 4-4, 4-3, 3-3, 5-3, 5-4
 - user's picture
